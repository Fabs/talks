## Introduction to the Lambda Calculus
speaker: Sven Tennie
categories: pl theory

The Lambda Calculus is the computational model behind functional programming languages and is often used in type theory.

To cover all the bits and pieces in a single talk would be too much. Therefore, we start with untyped Lambda Calculus:

- Structure and Evaluation,
- Currying,
- some Encodings (Booleans, Pairs, Numerals),

and broaden our understanding with follow-up talks.

## A Fist full of Types
speaker: Paul Heymann
categories: pl theory, Haskell, type system

Log entry #11253: I am still on my journey through the realm of type-level programming. There are strange beast out here and no end is in sight. I think it is time to share some learnings and experiences to prepare the folks which will follow.

And what could be better than to start at the beginning?

In this talk, we will ask ourselves the seemingly simple question 'what is a type?'. The answer will lead us to unknown places like types of types better known as kinds. Once understood, we will create our own kinds and we will learn how to use them to force our way into the depths of dependent types.
