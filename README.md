# Our central place to organize Talks
You want to check out the latest talk ideas and proposals and you want to add some? Then this is the place to be. Go to the   [issue tracker](https://github.com/lambda-pi-meetup/talks/issues) and have a blast. You will find proposals for upcoming talks and `want to see` issue. 

What is a `want to see` (wts), you ask? This is our way to add topic ideas without actually proposing them. So you don't have to give the talk but someone else can pick it up.

## Create a Proposal
There is a topic you want to talk about? Great. Open a new issue and follow these steps:

 1. Find a meaningful title to get people interest.
 2. Select a talk type:
     - lightning talk: 5min
     - firehose talk: 15min
     - long talk: 30min
 3. Select an audience:
     - beginner level
     - intermediate level
     - advanced level
 4. Put your talk into categories like Category Theory, Scala, Haskell, Type-level etc.
 5. Write down a short summary of your talk. This will also be used when announcing the next Meetup.

## Create a 'Want to see'
Basically ignore step 2 and 3 of 'Create a Proposal'.
