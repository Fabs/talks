## Preparations to host a Meetup
This is a short list of things a host should make sure are prepared.

 - [ ] Is the beamer working and the screen down?
 - [ ] Did you order drinks and snacks (if announced)?
 - [ ] Are they delivered and in the Meetup room?
 - [ ] re attendees able to reach the Meetup room on their own?
   - [ ] If they do, did you describe the way and added signes?
   - [ ] If they can't, did you organize a person to pick them up?
 - [ ] Do you have signes to indicate to a speaker how much time is left?
 - [ ] Do you have your camera ready to take pictures?
 - [ ] If the Meetup gets recorded:
   - [ ] Is the camera ready to record the speaker?
   - [ ] Is the microphone ready the records the speakers voice?
   - [ ] Are you able to record his screen or do you get his slides to record so you can do the recording on your notebook?
 - [ ] Is a laser pointer available?

Why do I write this done? Because I forgot most of it :).
